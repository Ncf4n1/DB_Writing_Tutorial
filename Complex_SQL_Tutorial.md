# __Introduction__
This tutorial is designed to discuss effective techniques to decomposing complex statements using Standard Query Language (SQL). Specifically, we will look at how to attack a seemingly overwhelming complex database query that will require the use of several SQL statements and SQL's inner join ability. By the end of this tutorial, we hope that you will be able to look a complex query, break it down into its simpler parts, and construct a SQL statement piece by piece.

## __Prerequisites__
Before we step into a brief review of SQL select and join statements, we are assuming that you have previous knowledge on Relational Databases and a brief introduction to the basic syntax of SQL, though not necessarily any practice with constructing moderate to complex SQL queries.
